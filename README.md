This repository contains a Python script designed for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis using `pandas`, `sklearn`, and `pandas_profiling`. The script focuses on loading a dataset, generating a detailed profiling report, and extracting correlation information. Key features include:

1. **Data Loading:**
   - Loads data from an Excel file located at `c:/data/cbi.xlsx`.

2. **Data Imputation:**
   - Imports `SimpleImputer` from `sklearn.impute` for handling missing values, although its usage is not explicitly shown in the provided snippet.

3. **Data Profiling:**
   - Utilizes `pandas_profiling` to generate a comprehensive profiling report titled "Titanic".
   - Extracts and prints the keys of the correlations section from the profile report's description for further analysis.

To set up and run the script:
- Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (`pandas`, `sklearn`, `pandas_profiling`).
- Adjust the file path for loading the dataset as needed.
- Run the script to generate the profiling report and view the correlation keys.

This script provides a quick and efficient way to perform initial data analysis and understand the relationships within your dataset.
